# SpaceInvaders-ish
A JavaScript game

Remember the old Atari Space Invaders? Similar, but only sort-of.

This is a work in progress, check back often to see the progression.

Play the game here:

 Built in JavaScript and HTML

Thanks for taking a look, and playing! I hope you enjoy the game, I did.

There are game engines out there to build faster and better games. This project was about learning JavaScript better.
