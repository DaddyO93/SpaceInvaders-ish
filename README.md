# SpaceInvaders-ish
A JavaScript game

Remember the old Atari Space Invaders? Similar, but only sort-of.

Play the game here:

I want to give credit where credit is due. The assets you see were made by one of my sons. He's an amateure sprite builder. The sound effects were built with the app BFXR (bfxr.net).
 
 Built in JavaScript and HTML

Thanks for taking a look, and playing! I hope you enjoy the game, I did.

There are game engines out there to build faster and better games. This project was about learning JavaScript better.
